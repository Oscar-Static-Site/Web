# High level introduction on how this site is hosted and why.

## Static files html and css
This is meant to be a static website, with HTML, CSS and little bit of JS, so the ideal hosting 
for it would be a cloud provider Bucket, and to manage those files we used the GO framework called hugo.

This website is meant more as DevOps infra showcase than Web developer. In that case I took the easy path for HTML and CSS.

## Cloud provider

For cloud provider I decided to go with AWS, even if it is a new to me and new, since this is a challenge I decided to use a different technology to learn about it and expand my knowledge.

Aswell I recognized the overwhelming demand of AWS over GCP so I think is good idea to learn it.

Once you know one provider and how to work in the cloud both work in similar ways but have their own quirks and special things about it.
The transition has been alright so far.

### Dns and SSL

Right now if you want a website an SSL certificate is a must and using https over http.

So I used Amazon Route 53 to purchase my domain, attached a CDN, (to cache static files and increase the website loading speed) with cloudfront and a ssl certificate thanks to aws certificate validator.
