# How is this website deployed  

## The hugo build and pushed to s3 in aws 

The pipeline is put together with DaggerIO, an interesting project based on Containers and docker.
They promisse build with code and run everywhere sounds good.
## Not becoming a yaml engineer. 

Yaml might be a very aprochable format but it has many flaws and there isn't much reduction of boilerplate that can be done and you're probably going to fuck up the indentation for it more hthan once.

So that's why I chose dagger and I ran it in Github Actions. I found the experience really good and easy to learn from someone not coming from a software devlopment land. That's learning Go on their own.

Yaml might have been enough for my use case, as it is very simple. Using go might have resulted in more code. But what I see there is the possibility of in bigger projects to create reusablecomponents that can save us time in the future.
