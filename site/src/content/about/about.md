## Oscar

## Self taught Computer Science Professional, with experience managing Google Cloud applications.

## In the last year of my career, I've discovered the things Iâ€™m more aligned to do.
## AUTOMATE everything!  Writing Infrastructure as code, CI/CD pipelines or scripts. Alongside this, playing and discovering more and more about Linux has been a wonderful experience.  I've enjoyed it so much,  that I've ended up replacing windows, and it has become my main Operating System!

## When im not working I find myself listening to music (mainly heavy metal), glued to a book, getting tattoos,
## or hiking around in the wildernes taking pictures.
