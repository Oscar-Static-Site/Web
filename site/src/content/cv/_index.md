A **DEVOPS** engineer with 1 year of experience working in Technology Well versed in helping teams deliver **high quality** applications 
{.center}

## Experience
- **Junior Devops** December 2022 - Present - **Natoora**
  - Managed and maintained cloud infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for multiple
  projects, supporting development, testing, and production environments. Utilized a
  combination of GCP services, including compute instances, cloud databases, Kubernetes
  clusters.
  - Implemented GitOps and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles using ArgoCD and Terraform.
  This streamlined the deployment process and ensured the consistency of environments across different stages of the development lifecycle. As a result, reduced the risk of configuration drift and improved overall system reliability.
  - Implemented strategic optimizations utilizing preemptible instances and ephemeral runners, resulting in a remarkable 80% reduction in costs associated with specific tasks. By leveraging cost-effective resources for non-critical tasks, I maximized budget utilizationwithout compromising the overall performance of the CI/CD process. Additionally, these optimizations led to a substantial 50% increase in the speed of CI/CD jobs, accelerating the delivery of high-quality applications and enabling faster feedback loops for development teams.
  - Led the adoption of a Prometheus and Grafana monitoring stack to monitor infrastructure and applications in real-time. Created custom dashboards and alerts to proactively identify and resolve issues, resulting in improved system uptime and reduced time-to-resolution for incidents.
- **Helpdesk support** March. 2022 – December 2022
  - Managed and maintained physical infrastructure, including Unifi and Cisco equipment, and pfSense firewalls.
  - Migrated on-premise legacy IPsec VPN to a modern Wireguard VPN hosted on the cloud,
  ensuring reliability in case of internet failure in the office.
  - Provided user support in multiple regions across multiple continents, developing strong
  problem solving and communication skills.

- **Chef Jobs** June 2019 - March 2022
  - Managed teams and developed strong communication skills.
  - Work in high-pressure environments
  - Developed high attention to detail
  - Learned how to prioritize tasks
