      <description>Oscar Self taught Computer Science Professional, with experience managing Google Cloud applications. In the last year of my career, I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered the things I’m more aligned to do. AUTOMATE everything! Writing Infrastructure as code, CI/CD pipelines or scripts. Alongside this, playing and discovering more and more about Linux has been a wonderful experience.
